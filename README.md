Exploring the use of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to generate an external web presence for the Consortium of Ohio Libraries
A modified version of [Hugo Academic](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic) is applied.

A few basic Hugo commands:

(1) Run server on localhost to draft changes
```bash
hugo -D server # http://localhost:1313/cool-info
```
(2) Generate files for deployment on production web server
```bash
hugo # generate new web files in /doc directory
```
