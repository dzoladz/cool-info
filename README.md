This is a repo for examining the use of Hugo to generate an external web presence for the Consortium of Ohio Libraries

A few basic Hugo commands:

Run server on localhost to draft changes
```bash
hugo -D server # http://localhost:1313/cool-info
```
Generate files for deployment on production web server
```bash
hugo # generate new web files in /doc directory
```
