On August 23, COOL upgraded to the 3.1 release of Evergreen. New features include search term highlighting in the public catalog and the ability to place multiple holds at once. This feature is extremely beneficial for book clubs and reading groups that need to place holds on multiple copies of a title.

The Consortium of Ohio Libraries contributed funding for the development of search term highlighting and indexing improvements to increase the efficiency of keyword searches. Thanks to MassLNC for spearheading this project and to all of the development partners, including:

- Bibliomation
- C/W Mars
- Evergreen Indiana
- Georgia PINES
- PAILS
