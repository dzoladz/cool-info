+++

Today the Germantown Public Library went live with Evergreen on the Consortium of Ohio Libraries shared catalog.

Evergreen is the open source ILS originally developed in Georgia and now in use by over 200 libraries in 22 states, and in 6 other countries. This count only includes reported installations, as anybody is free to download and install the software and try it out for themselves.

The Consortium of Ohio Libraries is a new consortium funded in part by an LSTA grant and supported by OHIONET in Columbus. Germantown is the second of the eight founding members to migrate onto the system.

If you have any questions about Evergreen or joining COOL, please feel free to contact Joe Knueven, director of Germantown, at 937-696-9998, ext. 10, or knuevejo@oplin.org or contacting the consortiumâ€™s president, Chauncey Montgomery, Director of the Community Library in Sunbury. He may be reached at 740-965-3901 or montgoc1@oplin.org.
