Galion Public Library joined COOL today, adding over 97,000 items to the COOL-CAT collection. We are very excited to have Galion in our group.  Galion Public Library is the 12th library to join COOL since its inception in 2012.  COOL is always open to new members. If you are interested becoming a COOL library, or if you want more information on the consortium or Evergreen, contact Matt Polcyn, Director of Technology Services at OhioNET, at mattp@ohionet.org or 800-686-8975.
