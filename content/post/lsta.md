A group of libraries was recently awarded a $108,092 Library Service Technology Act grant by the State Library of Ohio to fund the initial formation of Ohio’s first Evergreen consortium. Consisting of eight libraries, the Consortium of Ohio Libraries (COOL) has partnered with OHIONET in Columbus, Ohio, to oversee migration and support.

Funds awarded will assist four libraries with the initial installation, configuration, and migration to the open source ILS, Evergreen. The first library is scheduled to go live in mid-March. Four additional libraries are scheduled to be added by the end of 2013.
