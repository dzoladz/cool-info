On August 9th, Mt. Gilead Public Library and Cardington-Lincoln Public Library went live in COOL-CAT. Mt. Gilead and Cardington-Lincoln are the fourth and fifth libraries to migrate into the system. They join Community Library (Sunbury), Germantown Public Library, and Selover Public Library that migrated to COOL-CAT earlier this year.

COOL-CAT is the shared Evergreen catalog of the Consortium of Ohio Libraries. It is hosted and administered by OHIONET in conjunction with the member libraries and funded in part through an Institute of Museum and Library Services LSTA grant awarded by the State Library of Ohio.

If you have any questions about Evergreen or joining COOL, please visit http://info.cool-cat.org, or take a look at the catalog directly at http://www.cool-cat.org.
