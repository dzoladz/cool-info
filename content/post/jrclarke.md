Yesterday, J.R. Clarke Public Library in Covington went live in COOL-CAT, the shared catalog of the Consortium of Ohio Libraries. J. R. Clarke is the tenth library to migrate into the shared ILS since the consortium began in early 2012. COOL is running on Evergreen, the open source ILS, and is supported by OHIONET out of Columbus, Ohio.

To view J.R. Clarkeâ€™s catalog, visit http://jrclarke.cool-cat.org. Marvin Memorial Public Library in Shelby will be migrating in early 2014. For more information about COOL, contact Chauncey Montgomery at 740-965-3901 or chauncey@yourcl.org.
