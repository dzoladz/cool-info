On January 10, COOL became the first consortium on the Sequoia platform to upgrade to the 3.0 release of Evergreen. New features include the ability to batch edit patron records and the ability to send text message notifications to patrons 3 days prior to the due date of any circulting material. Release 3.0 initiates the transition from the XUL staff client to a web-based staff client for all Evergreen modules, including serials and acquisitions. Library staff will no longer need to download separate software to interact with Evergreen.

The Consortium of Ohio Libraries contributed funding for the development of the web-based staff client, along with the following organizations:

- Bibliomation
- British Columbia Libraries Cooperative
- C/W MARS
- Georgia Public Library Service
- Grand Rapids Public Library
- The Howe Library
- Kenton County Public Library
- King County Library System
- MassLNC
- NC Cardinal
- Pennsylvania Integrated Library System
- Pioneer Library System
