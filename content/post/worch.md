Today, the Worch Memorial Public Library went live with Evergreen on the Consortium of Ohio Libraries (COOL) shared catalog.

Worch Memorial is sixth of the nine founding members to migrate onto the system, with an estimated final library migration into the consortium scheduled for August 2013. Please visit the information site for more details about the Consortium, or take a look at the new catalog for Worch directly:  http://worch.cool-cat.org.

COOL is running on the open source ILS Evergreen. Originally developed by PINES (Public Information Network for Electronic Services) for the Georgia Public Library Service, Evergreen has since grown and is now used by over 1,000 libraries across 31 states, 4 countries, and 8 Canadian provinces. This count only includes reported installations, as anybody is free to download, install and try it out for their library.

If you have any questions about Evergreen or joining COOL, please feel free to contact consortium president Chauncey Montgomery, Director of the Community Library in Sunbury (montgoc1@oplin.org or 740-965-3901), or Meme Marlow, Director of the Worch Memorial Public Library, (marlowme@oplin.org or 937-526-3416).
