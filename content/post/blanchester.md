The Blanchester Public Library will be closed to the public Thursday, March 14, as it is scheduled to go live on the Evergreen shared catalog as part of the Consortium of Ohio Libraries (COOL).

Library patrons are strongly encouraged to have their library cards with them to check out materials beginning March 11 as staff members will have limited access to account information during the week. Patrons also will not be able to access their account or the current online catalog until the new system is in place. No overdue fines will be incurred during this time.

The library is one of nine founding members of COOL, which was formed in 2012. The consortium consists of independent libraries striving to provide innovative services while being more efficient with diminishing public resources.

Joining the consortium will give library cardholders quick access to more than 400,000 items held by the consortiumâ€™s libraries. Items at other COOL libraries will be easily requestable in the catalog and should be available for pickup at Blanchester Public Library within a week.

Moving to the Evergreen platform also puts the library in the forefront of the open source movement and gives it much more of a voice in the development of the product compared to the current product from a commercial vendor.

Evergreen was developed by several public libraries in Georgia in 2006 and is now used by more than 1,000 libraries, including most of the public libraries in Indiana, several in South Carolina, and by one of the largest public libraries in the United States, the King County Library System in Washington. The COOL catalog is hosted and administered by OHIONET in conjunction with the member libraries.

The other current COOL members are Cardington-Lincoln Public Library, Community Library in Sunbury, Germantown Public Library, Mt. Gilead Public Library, Selover Public Library, Worch Memorial Public Library, Wornstaff Memorial Library, and Arcanum Public Library.

The library will re-open at 10 a.m., Friday, March. 15. For more information, contact the Blanchester Public Library at (937) 783-3585.
