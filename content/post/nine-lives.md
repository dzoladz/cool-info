The Consortium of Ohio Libraries (COOL) is pleased to announce that Arcanum Public Library will be joining the consortium. Arcanum will be the ninth library in the consortium.  Migration of the collection and users into COOL-CAT will take place sometime in spring 2013.

COOL currently consists of Blanchester Public Library, Cardington-Lincoln Public Library, Community Library, Germantown Public Library, Mt. Gilead Public Library, Selover Public Library, Worch Memorial Public Library, Wornstaff Memorial Library, and now Arcanum Public Library.  COOL uses Evergreen, the open source ILS, and is funded in part by an LSTA grant and supported by OHIONET in Columbus.

For more information about COOL, please contact Chauncey Montgomery at 740-965-3901 or montgoc1@oplin.org.
