On Monday June 11th, COOL implemented a new SMS courtesy notification service for patrons. A text message reminder will be sent out 3 days prior to the due date of any circulating item. Patrons must opt-in to receiving SMS notifications, as well as have an SMS text number and carrier declared in their accounts to take advantage of this new notification.
