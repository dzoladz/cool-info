The Consortium of Ohio Libraries (COOL) is pleased to announce that the migration of the first library in the consortium is complete and the catalog, COOL-CAT, is live, purring, and available for patrons of the Community Library in Sunbury to locate items.

Following this initial migration, the Germantown Public Library will be joining in May of this year, followed by libraries in Chesterville, Cardington and Mt. Gilead at the end of summer.

Weâ€™d like to give a special thanks to OHIONET for all their help and support.
