On Tuesday, June 5th, the Selover Public Library went live with Evergreen on the Consortium of Ohio Libraries shared catalog, COOL-CAT.

COOL is made up of independent libraries that are striving to provide innovative library services while being more efficient with diminishing public resources. Selover is the third of eight libraries that are tagged to be added in the next few months. Members currently in COOL-CAT are Community Library in Sunbury, Germantown Public Library and Selover Public Library. The next libraries scheduled to migrate are Cardington Public Library and Mt. Gilead Public Library in August 2012.

Selover is excited and pleased with the transition to the COOL-CAT, it provides easier access to a much larger collection of library materials. Joining the consortium also allows greater convenience for library patrons who can now pick up and drop off materials at several local libraries.

Evergreen, the open source ILS originally developed by PINES (Public Information Network for Electronic Services) for the Georgia Public Library Service, is used by over 1,000 libraries across 31 states, 4 countries, and 8 Canadian provinces. This count only includes reported installations, as anybody is free to download, install and try it out for their library. The new Consortium of Ohio Libraries, initially funded by an LSTA grant and local library funding, is hosted and administered by OHIONET in conjunction with the member libraries. Take
