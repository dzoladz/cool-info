A user survey was completed before and after migration to assess how user-friendly Evergreen is compared to previous systems. Participants were asked to rate how easy it was to complete basic tasks in the catalog. Responses ranged on a scale from “very easy” to “very difficult” Following is a list of tasks with the percentage of respondents that answered “very easy” and “easy”.

|Task|Legacy System|Evergreen|
|:---|:-----------:|:-------:|
|Find a specific title.|80%|95%|
|Find titles based on a subject search.|65%|78%|
|Limit searches to a specific collection.|41%|56%|
|Understand the search results.|76%|77%|
|Place an item on hold.|88%|91%|
|Add items to a list or bookbag.|38%|79%|
|Access account information.|73%|92%|
|Renew items.|90%|87%|
|Request an item from another library.|50%|91%|

In all categories, with the exception of renewing items, ease-of-use increased in Evergreen. It is also worth noting that the survey was completed just a month after migration, so this represents going from systems that had been in place for years to a new system.

It is also worth noting that the survey was completed when we were still on Evergreen 2.1. We are now running Evergreen 2.3, which has a much more intuitive OPAC.
