Consortium of Ohio Libraries (COOL) is comprised of independent libraries that are striving to provide high-quality library services while being more efficient and prudent with diminishing public resources.

COOL is governed by a set of [Bylaws]({{< ref "policy/bylaws.md" >}}) and [Principles of Cooperation]({{< ref "policy/principles.md" >}}). 

<!-- Did we mention our use of open source [Technology]({{< ref "technology/technology.md" >}}) to support day-to-day library operations? -->
