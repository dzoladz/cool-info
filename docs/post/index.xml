      <title>Upgrade to Release 3.0</title>
      <link>https://dzoladz.github.io/cool-info/post/upgrade3-0/</link>

      <guid>https://dzoladz.github.io/cool-info/post/upgrade3-0/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On January 10, COOL became the first consortium on the Sequoia platform to upgrade to the 3.0 release of Evergreen. New features include the ability to batch edit patron records and the ability to send text message notifications to patrons 3 days prior to the due date of any circulting material. Release 3.0 initiates the transition from the XUL staff client to a web-based staff client for all Evergreen modules, including serials and acquisitions. Library staff will no longer need to download separate software to interact with Evergreen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Consortium of Ohio Libraries contributed funding for the development of the web-based staff client, along with the following organizations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bibliomation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;British Columbia Libraries Cooperative&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C/W MARS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Georgia Public Library Service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grand Rapids Public Library&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Howe Library&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kenton County Public Library&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;King County Library System&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MassLNC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NC Cardinal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pennsylvania Integrated Library System&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pioneer Library System&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SC LENDS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <guid>https://dzoladz.github.io/cool-info/post/rightclick2017/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two representatives from the Consortium of Ohio Libraries, Joe Knueven, Director of Germantown Public Library, and Derek Zoladz, Project Coordinator for the Consortium of Ohio Libraries, will be speaking at RightClick: The Library IT Idea Exchange Conference. Sponsored by the Ohio Library Councel&amp;rsquo;s Information Technology Division, this one-day conference for IT professionals, administrators and support staff will be held at the State Library of Ohio in downtown Columbus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the summaries for each presentation. We&amp;rsquo;ll see you there!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beam me up, Scotty: Migrating into an Evergreen Consortium&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dzoladz/rightclick2017&#34;&gt;Presentation Slides &amp;amp; Repo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you considered migrating to an open source ILS, but are unsure of the process? Migrating to a new ILS is a considerable undertaking, but the first step is to know what’s involved. Gain a better understanding of the framework for ILS migration including key considerations related to Evergreen. You will leave this session equipped with the information you need to continue exploring open source ILS migrations independently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Open Source? The Struggle Between Time, Money and Brains&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn more about the open source software at the Germantown Public Library, as well as some of the reasoning and rationale used in choosing software installations, and how the process has led to a preference for free open source software (FOSS).&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Greater Cincinnati area, namely, Covington, KY, has been selected as the location for the 2017 Evergreen International Conference. The proposal was developed by Joe Knueven, director of the Germantown Public Library, and is a multi-state collaborative effort including the Consortium of Ohio Libraries, Asbury Theological Seminary (KY), Asbury University (KY), Kenton County Public Library (KY), and Evergreen Indiana. Knueven has also been named chair of the conference committee and will oversee the planning and implementation of the event.

      <title>Floating in the Most Peculiar Way</title>
      <link>https://dzoladz.github.io/cool-info/post/floating/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 15 Apr 2016 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dzoladz.github.io/cool-info/post/floating/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple months ago, COOL started floating collections between independently governed and funded libraries. The goal is to reduce wait times for patrons at member libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how it works:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;COOL libraries purchase multiple copies of items with high hold/copy ratios.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Items are processed without any local branding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Items circulate throughout the consortium, without any geographic restrictions, on a “first in, first out” basis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once hold lists are fulfilled, the item resides where it was last returned and remains there until a hold from another library is generated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Looking at circulation numbers, it appears it is working as intended. Items with more than five holds per copy have reduced 12% since the project started. We only expect it to continue to improve as time goes on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe Knueven, director of Germantown Public Library and Chauncey Montgomery, director of Community Library (Sunbury) will be doing a in-depth presentation of the project at the 2016 EIC conference in Raleigh, NC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Authority Anyone?</title>
      <link>https://dzoladz.github.io/cool-info/post/authority/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 20 Jul 2015 13:33:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dzoladz.github.io/cool-info/post/authority/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest factors in having a successful catalog for your library or consortium is having good records!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, COOL has very recently partnered with Backstage Library Works (BSLW) and has instituted ongoing authority control for the catalog/database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dzoladz.github.io/cool-info/img/auth_control.png&#34; alt=&#34;image of a record&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ongoing, we will be loading both updated bibliographic records as well as authority records in an ongoing quarterly process.  At the same time, we’re instituting manual authority control procedures for locally created and eBook records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it’s certainly never easy, the end result will be a better catalog for both our patrons and staff!  If you have any questions for your library, drop us a line–we’ll be glad to help!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Upgrade to 2.7</title>
      <link>https://dzoladz.github.io/cool-info/post/upgrade2-7/</link>

      <guid>https://dzoladz.github.io/cool-info/post/upgrade2-7/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;COOL will be upgrading to Evergreen 2.7 this December. The 2.7 version includes a Web-based staff interface that allows staff to turn any device with Internet access and a Web browser into a staff client. We will be able to perform circulation almost anywhere we need to with little effort.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;COOL members just returned from the 2014 Evergreen International Conference in Boston. It was such a great event. We built relationships with Evergreen users from all over the world, we discussed upcoming software features, and we improved our knowledge of the software. COOL also co-presented a tutorial on reporting and participated in a welcome panel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dzoladz.github.io/cool-info/img/eic2014.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Evergreen Conference 2014&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Events like this reiterate that Evergreen is more than just an ILS; it is a community of librarians, developers, etc., working together to build the best library experience ever. We’re all looking forward to the 2015 EIC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information about Evergreen or COOL, please contact Lisa Murray at lmurray@cardlinc.org or Chauncey Montgomery at chauncey@yourcl.org.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Welcome J. R. Clarke</title>
      <link>https://dzoladz.github.io/cool-info/post/jrclarke/</link>

      <title>COOL Receives Library Innovation Award</title>
      <link>https://dzoladz.github.io/cool-info/post/olcaward/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2013 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dzoladz.github.io/cool-info/post/olcaward/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;At the 2013 Ohio Library Council Convention and Expo, the Consortium of Ohio Libraries (COOL) was awarded the Library Innovation Award for the planning and implementation of a statewide consortium using the open source ILS Evergreen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consortium was a response to the diminishing state funding. As funds decreased, libraries were forced to find ways to reduce costs while meeting the increased service demands. Joining a consortium was an obvious way to reduce costs by sharing support, hardware, and other administrative fees. A consortium also provides for seamless resource sharing between institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, COOL took the benefits of a consortium a step further and decided to use Evergreen, an open source ILS, because it provided a feature rich software package at a fraction of the cost of proprietary alternatives. Additionally, using open source software gives the consortium the ability to customize and add functionality based on individual needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://dzoladz.github.io/cool-info/img/cool-directors.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;COOL Directors&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project kicked off in early 2012, when the consortium was awarded an LSTA grant from the State Library of Ohio. By March of 2012, Community Library (Sunbury) was migrated into COOL-CAT. Since then eight other libraries have migrated and two more are scheduled to join in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COOL would like to thank everyone that has made the project a success. OHIONET has been a solid partner throughout this whole project and COOL would not exist without their support. The State Library of Ohio is to be thanked for awarding the LSTA grant funds to get the project off the ground. The Evergreen community has been very kind and generous with their support as the consortium came together. Finally, COOL is thankful to the staff, trustees, and patrons that have supported us as we took on this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
