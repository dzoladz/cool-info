      <guid>http://info.cool-cat.org/post/eic-2017/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Greater Cincinnati area, namely, Covington, KY, has been selected as the location for the 2017 Evergreen International Conference. The proposal was developed by Joe Knueven, director of the Germantown Public Library, and is a multi-state collaborative effort including the Consortium of Ohio Libraries, Asbury Theological Seminary (KY), Asbury University (KY), Kenton County Public Library (KY), and Evergreen Indiana. Knueven has also been named chair of the conference committee and will oversee the planning and implementation of the event.

      <title>Floating in the Most Peculiar Way</title>
      <link>http://info.cool-cat.org/post/floating/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 15 Apr 2016 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://info.cool-cat.org/post/floating/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple months ago, COOL started floating collections between independently governed and funded libraries. The goal is to reduce wait times for patrons at member libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how it works:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;COOL libraries purchase multiple copies of items with high hold/copy ratios.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Items are processed without any local branding.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Items circulate throughout the consortium, without any geographic restrictions, on a “first in, first out” basis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once hold lists are fulfilled, the item resides where it was last returned and remains there until a hold from another library is generated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Looking at circulation numbers, it appears it is working as intended. Items with more than five holds per copy have reduced 12% since the project started. We only expect it to continue to improve as time goes on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe Knueven, director of Germantown Public Library and Chauncey Montgomery, director of Community Library (Sunbury) will be doing a in-depth presentation of the project at the 2016 EIC conference in Raleigh, NC.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Authority Anyone?</title>
      <link>http://info.cool-cat.org/post/authority/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 20 Jul 2015 13:33:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://info.cool-cat.org/post/authority/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest factors in having a successful catalog for your library or consortium is having good records!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, COOL has very recently partnered with Backstage Library Works (BSLW) and has instituted ongoing authority control for the catalog/database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://info.cool-cat.org/img/auth_control.png&#34; alt=&#34;image of a record&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ongoing, we will be loading both updated bibliographic records as well as authority records in an ongoing quarterly process.  At the same time, we’re instituting manual authority control procedures for locally created and eBook records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it’s certainly never easy, the end result will be a better catalog for both our patrons and staff!  If you have any questions for your library, drop us a line–we’ll be glad to help!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Upgrade to 2.7</title>
      <link>http://info.cool-cat.org/post/upgrade2-7/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 20 Nov 2014 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://info.cool-cat.org/post/upgrade2-7/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;COOL will be upgrading to Evergreen 2.7 this December. The 2.7 version includes a Web-based staff interface that allows staff to turn any device with Internet access and a Web browser into a staff client. We will be able to perform circulation almost anywhere we need to with little effort.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Principles of Cooperation</title>
      <link>http://info.cool-cat.org/policy/principles/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2014 10:31:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://info.cool-cat.org/policy/principles/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;COOL will have a union catalog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;COOL will have a combined patron database. All libraries will be able to update patron information from all other libraries to make keeping up with new contact information easier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;COOL libraries will update patron information annually to keep current contact information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;COOL libraries will contribute the expertise of their staff in IT, cataloging, training, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;COOL libraries will keep their own library cards, but the barcodes will be recognized in all consortium libraries. Patrons shall be limited to one account per person.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patrons in good standing with their home library can borrow from the consortium. Patrons above the fine or overdue limit within their home library system will be blocked from borrowing from all COOL libraries regardless of the fine or overdue limits of the other library systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fines and fees can only be waived by the home library.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Libraries will use the statewide resource sharing delivery system and pay for contracted delivery costs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;COOL libraries must use the designated cataloging arrangement set by the Executive Board.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consortium borrowing.

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;COOL patrons can borrow and return items to any COOL library&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;COOL libraries will share any circulating resource, with the exception of realia, with any COOL library, and allow item age restrictions on new materials for up to three months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The borrowing library is responsible for the circulation, retrieval, and return of borrowed items.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The borrowing library’s fines and fees policies will apply to any item checked out through that library, regardless of where the item comes from. Fines collected will not be transferred between libraries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The lending library will absorb the cost of any lost or damaged materials.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Existing reciprocal borrowing agreements with libraries outside COOL will still be in force; however, patrons of those libraries will not be able to borrow items through COOL unless they have an account at a COOL library.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Libraries will process COOL requests daily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loan periods, including renewals, will conform to the borrowing library’s lending policies and will not exceed three months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;COOL members just returned from the 2014 Evergreen International Conference in Boston. It was such a great event. We built relationships with Evergreen users from all over the world, we discussed upcoming software features, and we improved our knowledge of the software. COOL also co-presented a tutorial on reporting and participated in a welcome panel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://info.cool-cat.org/img/eic2014.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Evergreen Conference 2014&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Events like this reiterate that Evergreen is more than just an ILS; it is a community of librarians, developers, etc., working together to build the best library experience ever. We’re all looking forward to the 2015 EIC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more information about Evergreen or COOL, please contact Lisa Murray at lmurray@cardlinc.org or Chauncey Montgomery at chauncey@yourcl.org.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Welcome J. R. Clarke</title>

      <title>COOL Receives Library Innovation Award</title>
      <link>http://info.cool-cat.org/post/olcaward/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 14 Oct 2013 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://info.cool-cat.org/post/olcaward/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;At the 2013 Ohio Library Council Convention and Expo, the Consortium of Ohio Libraries (COOL) was awarded the Library Innovation Award for the planning and implementation of a statewide consortium using the open source ILS Evergreen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consortium was a response to the diminishing state funding. As funds decreased, libraries were forced to find ways to reduce costs while meeting the increased service demands. Joining a consortium was an obvious way to reduce costs by sharing support, hardware, and other administrative fees. A consortium also provides for seamless resource sharing between institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, COOL took the benefits of a consortium a step further and decided to use Evergreen, an open source ILS, because it provided a feature rich software package at a fraction of the cost of proprietary alternatives. Additionally, using open source software gives the consortium the ability to customize and add functionality based on individual needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://info.cool-cat.org/img/cool-directors.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;COOL Directors&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project kicked off in early 2012, when the consortium was awarded an LSTA grant from the State Library of Ohio. By March of 2012, Community Library (Sunbury) was migrated into COOL-CAT. Since then eight other libraries have migrated and two more are scheduled to join in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COOL would like to thank everyone that has made the project a success. OHIONET has been a solid partner throughout this whole project and COOL would not exist without their support. The State Library of Ohio is to be thanked for awarding the LSTA grant funds to get the project off the ground. The Evergreen community has been very kind and generous with their support as the consortium came together. Finally, COOL is thankful to the staff, trustees, and patrons that have supported us as we took on this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;name-and-mission&#34;&gt;NAME AND MISSION&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Name of this organization shall be Consortium of Ohio Libraries (COOL).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The mission of the Consortium of Ohio Libraries is to meet the information needs of Ohioans through the cooperation of independent libraries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;membership&#34;&gt;MEMBERSHIP&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Members. There shall be one class of membership in COOL. Membership is held by the participating library. Each member library is a voting member with one vote on the Executive Board.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Qualifications. Membership shall be limited to any tax-payer funded library in Ohio that provides library services and offers a collection for loan beyond its district of service according to the policies and procedures established by COOL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Application for Membership. Prospective members may apply to join COOL by submitting a completed COOL Membership Agreement form to the Chair of the Executive Board. The Executive Board shall vote on all prospective membership applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Term. Membership shall be on a calendar year (January 1 – December 31), effective upon receipt of a signed COOL Membership Agreement. Membership is automatically renewed on an annual basis unless notification of termination is given as described in item E, “Termination”, below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Termination. Any member library can terminate membership in COOL by providing written notice to the Chair of the Executive Board as stated in the COOL Membership Agreement. Notice to terminate membership must be received 12 months before termination. The Executive Board may, by two-thirds (&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) majority of all Executive Board representatives, terminate a membership whenever in its judgment the best interests of COOL would be served.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Database. A member library entity leaving COOL or being terminated has the right to receive at cost with in six months a complete copy of its database with attached bibliographic records and patron records extracted from the COOL database in a format meeting the library’s needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working Groups. All member libraries will make available personnel to serve on any working group the Executive Board deems necessary to support COOL. Libraries that cannot assign a member to every working group agree to abide by the policies developed by the working groups and approved by the Executive Board.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;executive-board&#34;&gt;EXECUTIVE BOARD&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Number and Term. During the COOL initial pilot, all participating libraries will have a seat on the Executive Board filled by the director or a designee. Once membership in COOL reaches 20 members, the Executive Board will re-exam the structure of COOL governance with an eye toward making it a representative council with members appointed for two-year terms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Officers. The Executive Board shall elect the following officers: Chair, Vice-chair, Secretary, and Treasurer.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officers&amp;rsquo; Duties. The Chair, Vice-chair, and Secretary will perform the following duties and may perform other duties as assigned by the Executive Board:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;With the COOL Secretary, prepare and distribute an agenda three business days prior to each regular meeting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Represent COOL in consortium contracts executed and administered by OHIONET.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vice-chair

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assume the authority and responsibilities of Chair in the Chair&amp;rsquo;s absence or unavailability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Become Chair the following term.&lt;/li&gt;
