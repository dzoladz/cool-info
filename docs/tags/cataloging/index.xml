      <description>One of the biggest factors in having a successful catalog for your library or consortium is having good records!
With this in mind, COOL has very recently partnered with Backstage Library Works (BSLW) and has instituted ongoing authority control for the catalog/database.
Ongoing, we will be loading both updated bibliographic records as well as authority records in an ongoing quarterly process. At the same time, weâ€™re instituting manual authority control procedures for locally created and eBook records.</description>
