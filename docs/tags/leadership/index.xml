      <title>Floating in the Most Peculiar Way</title>
      <link>http://info.cool-cat.org/post/floating/</link>

      <description>A couple months ago, COOL started floating collections between independently governed and funded libraries. The goal is to reduce wait times for patrons at member libraries.
Here’s how it works:
 COOL libraries purchase multiple copies of items with high hold/copy ratios. Items are processed without any local branding. Items circulate throughout the consortium, without any geographic restrictions, on a “first in, first out” basis. Once hold lists are fulfilled, the item resides where it was last returned and remains there until a hold from another library is generated.</description>

      <description>COOL members just returned from the 2014 Evergreen International Conference in Boston. It was such a great event. We built relationships with Evergreen users from all over the world, we discussed upcoming software features, and we improved our knowledge of the software. COOL also co-presented a tutorial on reporting and participated in a welcome panel.
Events like this reiterate that Evergreen is more than just an ILS; it is a community of librarians, developers, etc.</description>

      <title>COOL Receives Library Innovation Award</title>

      <description>At the 2013 Ohio Library Council Convention and Expo, the Consortium of Ohio Libraries (COOL) was awarded the Library Innovation Award for the planning and implementation of a statewide consortium using the open source ILS Evergreen.
The consortium was a response to the diminishing state funding. As funds decreased, libraries were forced to find ways to reduce costs while meeting the increased service demands. Joining a consortium was an obvious way to reduce costs by sharing support, hardware, and other administrative fees.</description>

      <description>Tony Bandy of OHIONET and Chauncey Montgomery of Community Library (Sunbury) will be representing Ohio at the upcoming Evergreen International Conference in Vancouver. They will be presenting a session at the conference.
Following is a brief description of their session: While Evergreen continues to grow and innovate, more and more libraries and library consortium’s are moving to this amazing ILS system. However, for standalone libraries or newly formed consortiums, circulation within the system is a whole new game!</description>

      <description>Representatives from COOL libraries and OHIONET recently attended the 2012 Evergreen International Conference in Indianapolis. It was an excellent event and featured keynote speakers Jano Bacon, a leading community manager, engineering manager, consultant, and author, and Galadriel Chilton, Electronic Resource Management Librarian at University of Connecticut. Many of the sessions focused on future developments in Evergreen, especially features coming in version 2.2.
Many features will benefit patrons, such as auto-suggest, SMS, patron history (loans, fines, and holds), etc.</description>
