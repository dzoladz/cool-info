      <guid>https://dzoladz.github.io/cool-info/post/olcaward/</guid>
      <description>At the 2013 Ohio Library Council Convention and Expo, the Consortium of Ohio Libraries (COOL) was awarded the Library Innovation Award for the planning and implementation of a statewide consortium using the open source ILS Evergreen.
The consortium was a response to the diminishing state funding. As funds decreased, libraries were forced to find ways to reduce costs while meeting the increased service demands. Joining a consortium was an obvious way to reduce costs by sharing support, hardware, and other administrative fees.</description>

      <description>Migration went briefly like this: First: COOL consortium was formed with Principles of Cooperation, etc. A worthy item of note: you pretty much keep your own song sheet. Do, or don’t, charge for overdue books, have a special fine structure, etc. ? Your call.
Next: Pre-work before the migration. 4 1&amp;frasl;2 days (last week of January) introductory training at OhioNET, for various staff on certain days. Consortium and migration meetings and conference calls.</description>
