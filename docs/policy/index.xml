      <description>COOL will have a union catalog COOL will have a combined patron database. All libraries will be able to update patron information from all other libraries to make keeping up with new contact information easier. COOL libraries will update patron information annually to keep current contact information. COOL libraries will contribute the expertise of their staff in IT, cataloging, training, etc. COOL libraries will keep their own library cards, but the barcodes will be recognized in all consortium libraries.</description>
