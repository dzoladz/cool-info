&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;COOL will have a union catalog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;COOL will have a combined patron database. All libraries will be able to update patron information from all other libraries to make keeping up with new contact information easier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;COOL libraries will update patron information annually to keep current contact information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;COOL libraries will contribute the expertise of their staff in IT, cataloging, training, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;COOL libraries will keep their own library cards, but the barcodes will be recognized in all consortium libraries. Patrons shall be limited to one account per person.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patrons in good standing with their home library can borrow from the consortium. Patrons above the fine or overdue limit within their home library system will be blocked from borrowing from all COOL libraries regardless of the fine or overdue limits of the other library systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fines and fees can only be waived by the home library.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Libraries will use the statewide resource sharing delivery system and pay for contracted delivery costs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;COOL libraries must use the designated cataloging arrangement set by the Executive Board.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consortium borrowing.

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;COOL patrons can borrow and return items to any COOL library&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;COOL libraries will share any circulating resource, with the exception of realia, with any COOL library, and allow item age restrictions on new materials for up to three months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The borrowing library is responsible for the circulation, retrieval, and return of borrowed items.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The borrowing library’s fines and fees policies will apply to any item checked out through that library, regardless of where the item comes from. Fines collected will not be transferred between libraries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The lending library will absorb the cost of any lost or damaged materials.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Existing reciprocal borrowing agreements with libraries outside COOL will still be in force; however, patrons of those libraries will not be able to borrow items through COOL unless they have an account at a COOL library.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Libraries will process COOL requests daily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loan periods, including renewals, will conform to the borrowing library’s lending policies and will not exceed three months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;name-and-mission&#34;&gt;NAME AND MISSION&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Name of this organization shall be Consortium of Ohio Libraries (COOL).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The mission of the Consortium of Ohio Libraries is to meet the information needs of Ohioans through the cooperation of independent libraries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;membership&#34;&gt;MEMBERSHIP&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Members. There shall be one class of membership in COOL. Membership is held by the participating library. Each member library is a voting member with one vote on the Executive Board.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Qualifications. Membership shall be limited to any tax-payer funded library in Ohio that provides library services and offers a collection for loan beyond its district of service according to the policies and procedures established by COOL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Application for Membership. Prospective members may apply to join COOL by submitting a completed COOL Membership Agreement form to the Chair of the Executive Board. The Executive Board shall vote on all prospective membership applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Term. Membership shall be on a calendar year (January 1 – December 31), effective upon receipt of a signed COOL Membership Agreement. Membership is automatically renewed on an annual basis unless notification of termination is given as described in item E, “Termination”, below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Termination. Any member library can terminate membership in COOL by providing written notice to the Chair of the Executive Board as stated in the COOL Membership Agreement. Notice to terminate membership must be received 12 months before termination. The Executive Board may, by two-thirds (&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) majority of all Executive Board representatives, terminate a membership whenever in its judgment the best interests of COOL would be served.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Database. A member library entity leaving COOL or being terminated has the right to receive at cost with in six months a complete copy of its database with attached bibliographic records and patron records extracted from the COOL database in a format meeting the library’s needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working Groups. All member libraries will make available personnel to serve on any working group the Executive Board deems necessary to support COOL. Libraries that cannot assign a member to every working group agree to abide by the policies developed by the working groups and approved by the Executive Board.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Thirty (30) days prior written notice shall be given to all member libraries of proposed amendments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proposed amendments must be submitted in writing to the Executive Board Chair.&lt;/li&gt;
